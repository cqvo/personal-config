# Svelte 5 Documentation MCP Rule

## How to use:
Use the MCP to search Svelte 5 documentation instead of guessing. This ensures accuracy and prevents hallucinations.

## When to use it:
- When writing Svelte and unsure about changes from version 4 to 5.
- When encountering errors or unexpected behavior, even if you think you know the cause.
- Whenever a clarification is needed regarding Svelte 5 syntax, API, or best practices.

**Do not guess. Always verify with the MCP.**
